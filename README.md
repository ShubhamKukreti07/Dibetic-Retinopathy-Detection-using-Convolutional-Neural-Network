# Dibetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-Convolutional-Neural-Network
Developed a deep learning model for the automated detection of diabetic retinopathy from retinal images. Utilised convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to analyse retinal images and classify the severity of the disease. Employed data augmentation and image pre-processing to achieve high accuracy. The project aimed to assist in early diagnosis, improving patient outcomes by enabling timely treatment.
